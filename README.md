# State design pattern in TypeScript

Implemented a very simple [state design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) in TypeScript following this video: [State Design Pattern
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGEx35FjBuo)

I've used [deno](https://deno.land/) to run this project, so no `tsconfig.json` file.
To run it, install deno and just type
`deno run TestATMMachine.ts`
